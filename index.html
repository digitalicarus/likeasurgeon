			<h1>Like a Surgeon (General) <aside>Gov't warning for yer growler</aside></h1>
			<p>
				The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has a requirement
				that growlers must have a surgeon general warning label which:
				<ul>
					<li>Must be legible under ordinary conditions, and on a contrasting background.</li>
					<li>The words "GOVERNMENT WARNING" must be in capital letters and bold type. The rest of the statement may not appear in bold type.</li>
					<li>The maximum number of characters per inch of the warning statement is 25. All characters, including both upper and lower case, must be a minimum 2 millimeters in size.</li>
				</ul>

				To save you some pain, print some labels here and "laminate" them with
				packing tape to avoid a hassle at the tap. This is being enforced more
				and more in the state of Texas.
