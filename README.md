# Like a Surgeon (General)

*Gov't warning for yer growler*

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has a requirement that growlers must have a surgeon general warning label which: 
 * Must be legible under ordinary conditions, and on a contrasting background.
 * The words "GOVERNMENT WARNING" must be in capital letters and bold type. The rest of the statement may not appear in bold type.
 * The maximum number of characters per inch of the warning statement is 25. All characters, including both upper and lower case, must be a minimum 2 millimeters in size.

To save you some pain, print some labels using this "application" and "laminate" them with packing tape to avoid a hassle at the tap. This is being enforced more and more in the state of Texas.
